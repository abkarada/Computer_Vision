# 🧠 Computer Vision Projects with Python

Welcome to a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level **Computer Vision** projects using **Python** and **OpenCV**. This repository contains practical implementations of vision-based tasks for real-time or offline analysis.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder contains a specific task implemented using OpenCV and possibly other supporting libraries.

### 📦 Projects Included

| Project Name                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Edge Detection`             | Detects image edges using algorithms like Canny, Sobel, and Laplacian.     |
| `Face Detection`             | Detects human faces using Haar cascades and/or deep learning models.       |
| `Motion Filtering`           | Detects and highlights motion in videos using frame differencing methods. |
| `Real-Time People Counting`  | Counts the number of people in a video stream using object detection.      |

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x
